The EA automatically trails stop-losses of trades filtered according to your preferences and only when a trade has reached a certain number of profit points.

### FEATURES:
- It has, less external inputs and simpler display code. 
- It has cut-down features, features I probably wont use are, cut or hardcoded.

If you have any suggestions for improvement of this expert advisor, please fork your own version, I dont care so much about other people projects.
