## DESCRIPTION:
The Trailing Stop on Profit is an expert advisor for MT5 developed by EarnForex.com, and now forked by Wiseman-Timelord. Here is the [Original Project](https://github.com/EarnForex/Trailing-Stop-on-Profit). The EA automatically trails stop-losses of trades filtered according to your preferences and only when a trade has reached a certain number of profit points.

### FEATURES:
- It has, less external inputs and simpler display code. 
- It has cut-down features, features I probably wont use are, cut or hardcoded.

## NOTATION:
- A detailed description of the Original Expert Advisor is [Available Here](https://www.earnforex.com/metatrader-expert-advisors/Trailing-Stop-on-Profit/). If you have any suggestions for improvement of this expert advisor, please fork your own version, I dont care so much about other people projects.

## WARNINGS:
- I advise people use the original, as my Mql5 code typically requires more, testing and bugfixing, additionally this is a fork, so I may not inspect all of the code in the original version of the software. You are responsible for any, money lost or hardware broken.
